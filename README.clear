Create vendored dependencies for offline build by updating the
projects/helm-vendor repository. In helm-vendor, run `make VER="<HelmVer>"` to
automate most of the process, where <HelmVer> is the upstream helm version
(without the "v" prefix).

If a hotfix helm-vendor release is ever needed, extend the release version with
a 4th number. For example, a hotfix release for helm-vendor 3.0.3 would have
version "3.0.3.1", a second hotfix release would be "3.0.3.2", etc.
